- [TREATMENTS](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/hello-world/): Preventive Laser Surgery Lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) are an integral part of treatment of numerous eye ailments, and several types of lasers are used. At PNRF we have several lasers for a variety of treatments.Lasers can be used for prevention in the form of laser iridotomy (a small hole in the iris) for glaucoma or before insertion of ICL. This is to provide an alternative route for movement of fluid in the anterior chamber, thus preventing glaucoma in the future. In high Myopes and other degenerative conditions of the retina, Prophylactic Laser Photocoagulation of the Retina...
- [GLAUCOMA](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/7-ways-to-get-more-sleep-naturally/): Glaucoma damage may be caused by raised eye pressure or a weakness in the structure surrounding in the optic nerve. Our eye pressures may be within normal limits but damage occurs because there is a weakness in the optic nerve which in turn affects blood flow to the nerve.NOTE: Eye pressure is not connected to your blood pressure. Diagnosis of GlaucomaA thorough consultation is required if there is any suspicion that you might have glaucoma. The examination involves measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP), Center corneal thickness, Gonioscopy(measurement of anterior chamber angle) as well as evaluation of the optic nerve, specifically the...

- [Macular degeneration](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/macular-degeneration/): Macular Degeneration (ARMD)Although a leading cause of blindness in people 60 and older, there are measures that can be taken to slow the progression of the condition, and newer treatments can help reduce irreversible blindness.What is age-related macular degeneration?Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that causes painless loss of central vision and is most common in people over the age of 50. AMD currently is one of the leading cause of vision loss in the developed world. It is estimated that at least 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have some signs of AMD and...
- [Macular Hole](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/macular-hole/): A macular hole is a small break or opening in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision needed for activities like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. It typically occurs due to age-related changes in the vitreous (the gel-like substance inside the eye), which can shrink and pull on the macula, eventually causing a hole. Macular holes can lead to blurred or distorted central vision and, if left untreated, may result in significant vision loss in the affected eye. Early-stage holes may stabilize or improve on their own, but most cases require vitrectomy surgery, where...
- [Endophthalmitis](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/endophthalmitis/): As suggested by the name, endophthalmitis means infection inside the eye. This is a vision threatening condition which may occur due to trauma to the eye, intra-ocular foreign bodies and very rarely after surgery to the eye. On occasion it may also occur without surgery, by transfer via blood from another source of infection in the body (Endogenous). Under normal conditions, the inside of the eye is sterile and clear so that light may enter the eye and the person sees. Infection inside the eye results in a strong bodily response as occurs anywhere else in the body. But invasion...
- [Medical Retina](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/medical-retina/): Medical Retina Not all vitreo-retinal conditions require surgical intervention. Some are managed totally by medical means in the form of eye drops, tablets and injections. Macular Degeneration, CRVO, BRVO and optic neuritis are examples of disease which come under the purview of medical retina. Macular Degeneration (ARMD) Age Related Macular Degeneration is a condition seen is older persons in which results in painless loss of central vision. This may be quite debilitating as the macula (area of sharpest vision) is primarily affected.  Assessment and progression are done by non invasive OCT.  Many patients are benefited by intra-ocular injections of certain...
- [Retinal Detachment](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/retinal-detachment/): Retina is the innermost light sensitive layer of the eye which converts the light entering the eye and focusing upon it, into electrical impulses which are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. There, these impulses are interpreted as an image. Retinal detachment, as the name suggests, is said to occur if the retina detaches from other layers of the eye. Patients complain of sudden painless loss of vision which may affect a part or the whole of the visual field. This may progress from partial to complete loss of vision if not treated. In very severe cases, not...
- [Vitreous Bleeds](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/vitreo-retinal-services/vitreous-bleeds/): Vitreous is the name of the deep-seated, clear, gel-like substance found inside the eyeball which is responsible for maintaining the shape of the eye. Vitreous bleeds or haemorrages are actually a misnomer as it is not the vitreous that bleeds (as the vitreous itself has no blood vessels), but rather the retinal vessels which bleed into the vitreous. Vitreous hemorrhage or bleeding inside the eye is a serious condition which may occur due to trauma or due to certain diseases of the eye like Diabetic Retinopathy or Eale’s disease. Bleeding may be minor leading to complaints of ‘shower of particles’...
- [GLAUCOMA](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/glaucoma-2/): Glaucoma is the name given to a group of eye conditions which causes optic nerve damage and in turn can permanently affect vision. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve at the point where it leaves the eye.Glaucoma damage may be caused by raised eye pressure or a weakness in the structure surrounding in the optic nerve. Our eye pressures may be within normal limits but damage occurs because there is a weakness in the optic nerve which in turn affects blood flow to the nerve.NOTE: Eye pressure is not connected to your blood pressure. Diagnosis of GlaucomaA thorough consultation is required if...
- [Topoguided LASIK](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/laser-vision-correction/topoguided-lasik/): Topography-guided LASIK (often branded as Contoura Vision) is an advanced form of laser eye surgery that uses highly detailed corneal maps to customize treatment based on the unique shape and surface irregularities of a person’s eye. Unlike standard LASIK, which corrects common refractive errors like nearsightedness or astigmatism, topography-guided LASIK also targets subtle corneal imperfections that can cause glare, halos, or poor night vision. This precision often results in sharper vision, reduced visual distortions, and in some cases, better-than-20/20 outcomes. It’s especially beneficial for patients with irregular corneas or those seeking the most refined vision correction, though it may be...
- [PTK &amp; PRK](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/laser-vision-correction/ptk-prk/): Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) is a type of eye surgery that uses a laser to treat various ocular disorders by removing tissue from the cornea. PTK allows the removal of superficial corneal opacities and surface irregularities. The common indications for PTK are corneal dystrophies, scars and opacities. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a type of refractive surgery to correct myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism. PRK was the first type of laser eye surgery for vision correction and is the predecessor to the popular LASIK procedure. Even now it is used in patients who have a thinner cornea, as PRK affects the corneal thickness less. PRK involves the Laser vision correction...
- [LASIK](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/laser-vision-correction/lasik/): LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) is one of the most widely performed and effective laser eye surgeries for correcting refractive vision errors such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. The procedure involves creating a thin corneal flap—either with a microkeratome blade or a femtosecond laser—lifting it to expose the underlying corneal tissue, and then reshaping the cornea using an excimer laser to improve how light is focused on the retina. LASIK is typically quick, taking about 15 minutes for both eyes, with most patients experiencing significant vision improvement within 24 to 48 hours. It offers high success rates, minimal...
- [Glued IOL](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/cataract-services/glued-iol/): Routine intra ocular lenses (IOLs) are placed inside the remains of the lens capsule after removal of the clouded natural lens material. The lens implants hang by their haptics safely inside the ‘bag’ at the very anatomical position of the natural lens. But in some patients, due to trauma, disease or some congenital conditions, the capsule into which the lens implants are normally deposited is absent or damaged and incapable of securely holding the lens implant. Earlier this used to mean the surgeon had to resort to implanting an anterior chamber IOL which is placed in front of the iris....
- [Verion Assisted Surgery](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/cataract-services/verion-assisted-surgery/): Since time immemorial, eye surgeons have struggled and strived to give patients the best visual outcome after cataract surgery. Incisions got smaller, better lens implants were developed and outcomes improved. But the problem of incision induced astigmatism continued to be an issue. No matter how small the incision, upon healing it produces a pull on the cornea, distorting its natural curvature, thus impacting vision after surgery. This often resulted in the necessity of astigmatic spectacles. Various calculations were made to plan incisions so that this impact could be reduced but reliable results could not be attained. Finally, technology came to...
- [YAG Capsulotomy](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/yag-capsulotomy/): During cataract surgery, the opaque material of the natural lens inside the eye is removed so that light may again pass to the retina and re-establish clear vision. After cataract surgery, some people notice cloudiness (sometimes called aftercataract) after several months or years. In some people, it can become very dense and cause as much or more vision loss as the original cataract. This is due to the clouding of that part of the lens covering (posterior capsule) that remains in the eye after surgery ,on which the lens is placed. This is the most common complication of cataract surgery. If...
- [LENS IMPLANT](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/lens-implants/): A focusing lens implant is typically placed in the eye at the time of cataract surgery. Insertion of a Monofocal lens is standard practice. Unfortunately a standard monofocal lens will not correct astigmatism, nor provide good depth of focus with a clear image at near, intermediate and distance. A variety of “added value” Premium lenses are available and include: Monofocal Toric Lens This is a lens that corrects astigmatism in those who have a high amount. Like an astigmatic spectacle or contact lens, astigmatism correction is built into the implant. The lens implant which needs to be specially ordered, is inserted into the...

- [PHACOEMULSIFICATION](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/cataract-services/phacoemulsification/): Phacoemulsification is a modern cataract surgery procedure in which an ultrasonic device is used to break up and then remove a cloudy lens, or cataract, from the eye to improve vision. The lens matter is broken up, emulsified and then sucked out of the eye. The aspirated fluid is simultaneously replaced with irrigation of a balanced salt solution. The insertion of an intraocular lens (IOL) usually immediately follows phacoemulsification. To reduce post surgical astigmatism, the main incision wound has now been reduced from 2.8mm to less than 2.4mm. The procedure is then known as Micro Incision Cataract Surgery (MICS).
- [Macular Degeneration (ARMD)](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/macular-degeneration-armd/): Although a leading cause of blindness in people 60 and older, there are measures that can be taken to slow progression of ARMD and newer treatments can help reduce irreversible blindness. What is age-related macular degeneration? Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that causes painless loss of central vision and is most common in people over the age of 50. AMD currently  is one of  the leading cause of vision loss in the developed world. It is estimated that at least 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have some signs of AMD and that its...
- [Diabetic Eye](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/diabetic-eye/): Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease with significant effects in certain organs of the body and the eyes are one of them. Diabetic patients are susceptible to numerous eye ailments more than the non-Diabetic population. Some effects can be avoided with good control of blood sugar whereas others are inevitable after a certain number of years of the disease. Therefore it is highly recommended that diabetics get their eyes examined by a doctor at least once a year to monitor for any changes. The following eye conditions are seen more frequently in diabetics or at an earlier age than the...
- [Errors of Refraction](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/errors-of-refraction/): Shortsightedness or Myopia is relatively common. Most people use glasses or contact lenses to cope, but there are many vision correction options available including: Patients who are shortsighted have a steep cornea and/or a long eye. This means that the point of focus falls short of the retina and the patient will struggle to focus on things in the distance. The longer the eye and/or steeper the cornea the higher the level of shortsightedness. Shortsightedness can be corrected by flattening the cornea and making it less powerful. This moves the point of focus backwards to fall onto the retina. Higher prescriptions require a...
- [Computer Vision Syndrome](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/computer-vision-syndrome/): This is a form of Dry Eye which is related to long hours of work at one’s computer. Dry air-conditioned air and the tendency to stare at the screen without blinking for many hours at a stretch, leads to symptoms of dry eyes and eye strain. Change in work habits & work place environment along with medical treatment can provide relief in symptoms.
- [Dry Eye](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/dry-eye/): A thin layer of tears constantly keeps the surface of the eye exposed to the environment wet. These tears are produced by a small gland in the outer part of the upper eyelid. Every time we blink, the eye is coated with a thin layer of tears. Excess secretion occurs to flush out any dust or foreign particle that comes into our eyes and also in response to certain emotions, as we all know! An inadequate amount of tear secretion or disturbance in the tear composition results in the condition known as dry eye. Patients complain of burning sensation, foreign...
- [Cataract](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/cataract/): Cataract A cataract is a loss of transparency or clouding of the normally clear crystalline lens of the eye. This lens is a part of the eye that helps focus light on the retina. It is located behind the iris. With age it becomes harder and leads to difficulty in reading or Presbyopia. As time progresses the lens becomes cloudy and affects vision. Cataracts are sometimes seen in younger persons due to disease, trauma or drug toxicity. Lens opacities may even occur in infants, which may be congenital or due to certain diseases during pregnancy.

- [Regular Eye Check-up](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/regular-eye-check-up/): Medicine is one of the fields in which the cliché ‘Prevention is better than cure’ finds its true meaning. No less so in the field of Ophthalmology. Early recognition of eye conditions can frequently prevent disease or at least lessen its effects. This is particularly relevant in persons with Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension and certain hereditary diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa. Slowly developing changes can easily be missed unless specifically looked for by a doctor. A regular check-up would consist of assessment of vision, visual acuity, slit lamp examination, a look at the retina and possibly assessment of field of vision. Depending...

The eyes may also be affected during accidents at home, at work or even on the street. All ages are susceptible and all manner of damage may occur from minor to vision threatening or eyeball threatening injuries, including the introduction of infection into the otherwise sterile eye environs. As varied as accidents can be, so can be injuries to the eye. Any layer or structure can be affected from the superficial lid and lacrimal...
- [Keratoconus Treatments](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/keratoconus-treatments/): What is Keratoconus? The word Keratoconus is formed by two Greek words: kerato, meaning cornea, and konos, meaning cone. Keratoconus is a condition in which the shape of the cornea, which is usually round, is distorted, developing a cone-shaped bulge, resulting in harm to vision. Progression of the condition depends on the patient’s age at the time of the onset. The earlier the onset, the faster keratoconus progresses. The condition is always bilateral and asymmetric – meaning that it affects both eyes, however one eye may be more affected than the other. What causes Keratoconus? Keratoconus is a condition that...

- [Cataract Services](https://salmon-fly-565046.hostingersite.com/cataract-services/): A cataract is the normal clouding of the natural lens of the eye. This is a normal part of the aging process. Uncommonly it is also seen in young age in certain people (diabetics) and in certain situations (trauma or congenital cataracts). The normal function of the natural lens is to focus the image of what we are looking at precisely on the retina. With clouding not only the clarity but color, contrast sensitivity and the lens’ natural flexibility decrease. The end result, in extreme cases, is blindness. But this is easily corrected by surgery when the opaque lens is...
